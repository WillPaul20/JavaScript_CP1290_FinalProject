# JavaScript CP1290 Final Project:

**Description:**

-Mine Sweeper was a game a played a lot of on my Windows 97 machine as a kid, so this project seems like it will be a fun experience and give myself experience with a new JavaScript library and a new project to add to my GitHub profile.

-I plan to utilize information gathered from a YouTube tutorial I have recently found using a JavaScript library called “P5.js” to build a web-browser based version of “Mine Sweeper”.

-At this time my goal is to build out a fully functioning base version of the game and allow for the user to select their difficulty (i.e Number of mines) and have a scoring system built in as well.
