# JavaScript CP1290 Final Project:

## How it Works:

Minesweeper is a game of probabilities. *"What are the chances there's a mine behind this grid?"* The higher the difficulty, the more chances there's a mine. The game will default to **"Moderate"**, but you can change the difficulty at any time and it will re-draw the game board. I challenge you to complete the game on **"Difficult"**!

Depending on the numbers surrounding that grid... it could be pretty high! You will need to use the numbers on exposed grids to help you identify where the nearby mines are. If there's a bunch of 1's around a group of unchecked grids you're pretty safe. But if those 1's become 2's or 3's, You need to tread safely and dig carefully using the ***left click*** to expose what's underneath. Use flags by ***right clicking*** to mark grids you think could be a mine.

Finally, if you've cleared all spaces except those pesky mines. Well, you win the game! However... if you manage to dig up a mine, that's a bit of a different story and you'll be faced with a game over to try again!

## Why Minesweeper?

Mine Sweeper was a game a played a lot of on my Windows 97 machine as a kid, so this project seems like it will be a fun experience and give myself experience with a new JavaScript library and a new project to add to my GitHub profile.

I plan to utilize information gathered from a YouTube tutorial I have recently found using a JavaScript library called “P5.js” to build a web-browser based version of “Mine Sweeper”.

At this time my goal is to build out a fully functioning base version of the game and allow for the user to select their difficulty (i.e Number of mines) and have a scoring system built in as well.
